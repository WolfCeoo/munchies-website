# Munchies - Hyper-Local Food Delivery Website (Soshanguve)

A clean, mobile-first static website for **Munchies**, a hyper-local food delivery service based in Soshanguve, South Africa. The site showcases partner vendors, teases authentic township street food (kota, burgers, platters, stews), and drives users to a Fillout form for real-time ordering (only in-stock items are shown).

## Why this project?
Built as a real-world MVP for a hyper-local delivery startup in my community (Soshanguve).  
Focus was on:
- Fast mobile experience (90%+ of users on phones)
- Clean, authentic township aesthetic
- Driving conversions to the order form
- Easy maintenance & free hosting

## Future Improvements (planned)
- Custom domain (munchies.co.za or similar)
- Favicon & meta tags for better sharing
- WhatsApp "Order Now" button fallback
- Basic analytics (Google Analytics or Plausible)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline viewing
